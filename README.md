## Features

- 5x5 grid puzzle
- Randomized board with multipliers and Voltorbs
- Number clues for rows and columns (sum + number of Voltorbs)
- Right-click to mark suspected Voltorbs
- Level progression when all 2x/3x tiles are revealed
- Level resets if a Voltorb is flipped
- Score carries over between levels
- High score tracking

## Controls

- **Left-click**: Flip a tile

## Leveling Logic
